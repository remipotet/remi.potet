Pretty much a lot of things. Big fan of video games, as a player and industry enthusiast. I am into cultural products in general: cinema, literature, music...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I have learnt C basics with CS50 and the great David J. Malan (first 5 courses).
I switched to C# because I wanted to work on Unity and on some game designs I had in mind... but I am pretty much at the learning state for now haha
I consider learning either Python or web languages after - HTLM, CSS... seem a good idea to make like a display website and since I work in marketing, it could be useful!
